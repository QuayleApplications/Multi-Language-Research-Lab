- **Date:** 2025-11-06
- **Session Type:** Environment Setup
- **Project / Domain:** Language Studies
- **Duration:** 1 hr
- **Tools Used:** ChatGPT, VS Code, Github

---

## 2. Objective / Question
- Set up a git repository on GitHub for this project
- Add journal entries and establish proper version control practices.

---

## 3. Context / Setup
I needed to establish version control early in this project to ensure all changes and data are tracked accurately.

This also supports my goal of improving familiarity and mastery of Git and GitHub while developing new daily processes aligned with my professional and academic objectives.

## 4. Process / Actions Taken
- Logged into my existing GitHub account.  
- Created a new repository for this project (with a license only).  
- Cloned the repository locally.  
- Moved the existing project files into the newly created directory.  
- Added and formatted journal entries according to the research template.  
- Utilized ChatGPT to review grammar, spelling, and tone for professionalism.

## 5. Insights / Discoveries
- How to properly format and structure a research journal entry.  
- Increased familiarity with the research documentation process.  
- Continued improvement in Markdown formatting and Git version control.

## 6. Challenges / Questions Raised
- **Issue:** My professional tone, grammar, and spelling still need refinement.  
- **Uncertainty:** Confidence in my writing ability.  
- **Next Steps:**  
  - Test PHP lab.  
  - Automate implementation of new language environment setups.  
  - Reduce reliance on ChatGPT during development.

## 7. Reflection / Meta-Learning
Although ChatGPT didn’t find many grammatical issues in my writing, I recognize the need to continue improving my professional tone and written clarity.

This exercise reinforced that writing precision is part of academic rigor, not an afterthought.
