## 1. Project and Process set up
- **Date:** 2025-11-05
- **Session Type:** Environment Setup
- **Project / Domain:** Language Studies
- **Duration:** 2 hrs
- **Tools Used:** ChatGPT, VS Code

---

## 2. Objective / Question
Can I create a reproducible environment for language-agnostic research experiments and cultivating a deeper understanding of programming paradigms and language design?

---

## 3. Context / Setup
While working through PHP 8 Objects, Patterns, and Practice: Mastering OO Enhancements, Design Patterns, and Essential Development Tools (6th ed.) by Matt Zandstra, I was unable to locate a reasonably priced platform to work through the examples in a consistent, reliable, and affordable format.

Having worked with Docker previously, I was familiar with some of its capabilities and wanted to see if the problem could be solved for the price of “free 99.”

## 4. Process / Actions Taken
- Proposed my first practice research question *["How does PHP handle primitive data types in memory?"](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bfcdjkgJqFl81vQYJGmdGN0yngITm7-nLzP-mjQ2SaQ/edit?usp=sharing)*
- I ran the concept through ChatGPT to see if I could quickly generate a solution for the PHP language and the ability to alternate between specific versions
- ChatGPT provided me with an example docker-compose.yml file and a reproducible file structure
- After reviewing the provided example, I decided to implement a solution for the 12 languages that I have decided are vital to my personal and professional goals: 
    - Bash
    - C++
    - C#
    - Go
    - Java
    - JavaScript
    - MySQL
    - NodeJS
    - PHP
    - Python
    - Rust
    - SQL/SQLite
- I implemented a initial concept, re-established the file structure, generated a template directory then had ChatGPT review and provide feedback on the structure.
- After a few reviews and refining the project I decided it was in a good enough place to support my initial goals, an MVP if you will.

## 5. Insights / Discoveries
- Docker can be configured to support thorough, in-depth practice across multiple languages and versions.
- Each language has subtle differences in its Docker environment setup, deployment process, and runtime requirements — understanding these distinctions is crucial for accurate experimentation.

---

## 6. Challenges / Questions Raised
- **Issue**: Limited familiarity with Docker and several of the target languages.
- **Uncertainty**: Each language container still needs to be tested and verified for consistency.
- **Next Steps**:
    - Set up GitHub Repo
    - Testing php lab
    - Automate implementation of new language environment setups
    - Reduce reliance on ChatGPT during development

---

## 7. Reflection / Meta-Learning
- I’m realizing that I am not as proficient as I believed in several areas I consider core to my long-term goals.
- I still rely too heavily on ChatGPT for solutions and idea validation.
- My project structures and programming vocabulary could use refinement.

---

## 8. Next Steps / Action Items
- [ ] Set up GitHub Repo
- [ ] Test PHP lab
- [ ] Automate implementation of new language environment setups
- [ ] Reduce ChatGPT dependency
